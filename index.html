    <p> Here are some two things I enjoy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bantering the people</li>
      <li>Enjoying memes</li>
      <li>Roasting My friends</li>
      <li>High Energy Sports</li>

    <p>The stronghold of the determinist argument is the antipathy to the idea of chance...This notion of alternative
      possibility, this admission that any one of several things may come to pass is, after all, only a roundabout name
      for chance. William James is an author and a founder of modern Philosophy as we know it and relate to him
      immensely.

      If theological ideas prove to have a value for concrete life, they will be true, for pragmatism, in the sense of
      being good for so much. For how much more they are true, will depend entirely on their relations to the other
      truths that also have to be Acknowledged.</p>
